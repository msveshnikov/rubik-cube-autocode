# Sprint 1 Plan

## Sprint Goal
Establish the core 3D Rubik's cube simulation with basic interactive controls, laying the foundation for future feature development.

## Sprint Duration
2 weeks

## Selected Items (Priority Order)

1. **Interactive 3D Cube Rendering** (8 points)
   - Set up Three.js environment
   - Implement basic cube mesh and materials
   - Create initial camera and lighting setup
   - Ensure smooth rendering performance
   - Dependencies: None
   - Risk: Performance optimization for lower-end devices

2. **Basic Cube State Management** (5 points)
   - Implement cube state data structure
   - Create state update mechanisms
   - Set up move validation logic
   - Dependencies: Item #1
   - Risk: Complex state management edge cases

3. **Standard Move Controls** (5 points)
   - Implement R, L, U, D, F, B moves
   - Add rotation animations
   - Create move queue system
   - Dependencies: Items #1, #2
   - Risk: Animation timing and smoothness

4. **Mouse/Touch Interaction** (5 points)
   - Implement drag controls
   - Add face selection logic
   - Create rotation gesture handling
   - Dependencies: Items #1, #2, #3
   - Risk: Cross-browser compatibility

5. **Keyboard Controls** (3 points)
   - Add keyboard shortcuts
   - Implement move mapping
   - Create keyboard feedback
   - Dependencies: Items #2, #3
   - Risk: None significant
