Here's the updated product backlog based on the project state and documentation:

# Product Backlog

## High Priority (Must Have)

1. Core 3D Cube Implementation

    - Interactive cube rendering using Three.js
    - Basic rotation animations
    - Face color management
    - Performance optimization for 3D rendering

2. Basic Move Controls

    - Standard cube notation (R, L, U, D, F, B)
    - Mouse/touch drag controls
    - Keyboard shortcuts
    - Move validation

3. Basic Tutorial System
    - Beginner's method introduction
    - Interactive step guidance
    - Progress tracking
    - Basic move demonstrations

## Medium Priority (Should Have)

4. Theme System

    - Light/dark mode
    - Color customization
    - Cube sticker themes
    - UI consistency

5. Progress Tracking

    - Solve time tracking
    - Move count statistics
    - Learning progress indicators
    - Local storage implementation

6. Mobile Optimization

    - Responsive design
    - Touch controls
    - Performance optimization
    - Gesture support

7. Localization Framework
    - Multi-language support
    - RTL layout handling
    - Cultural adaptations
    - i18n implementation

## Low Priority (Nice to Have)

8. Advanced Features

    - Algorithm visualization
    - Multiple solving methods (CFOP, Roux, ZZ)
    - Custom cube patterns
    - Speed solving techniques

9. Community Features

    - Progress sharing
    - Custom algorithm sharing
    - Social media integration
    - Achievement system

10. Extended Accessibility
    - Screen reader optimization
    - Color blind modes
    - Custom animation speeds
    - Voice commands

## Future Considerations

- AR/VR Support
- Offline functionality
- Cross-device synchronization
- Real-time multiplayer features

## Technical Debt Items

1. Test coverage implementation
2. Performance monitoring setup
3. Security hardening
4. Code documentation
5. Accessibility compliance

## Notes

- Priority order considers both user value and technical dependencies
- Mobile optimization moved up in priority due to user feedback
- Community features scope reduced to focus on core functionality
- AR/VR support moved to future considerations due to complexity
- Added technical debt items to ensure long-term maintainability

## Definition of Done

- Feature implemented and tested
- Documentation updated
- Accessibility requirements met
- Performance benchmarks passed
- Code reviewed and approved
- Mobile compatibility verified
- Browser compatibility confirmed

This backlog will be reviewed and updated every sprint based on user feedback and development
progress.
